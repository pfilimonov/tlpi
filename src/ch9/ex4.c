/*
 * If a process whose user IDs all have the value X executes a set-user-ID
program whose user ID, Y, is nonzero, then the process credentials are set as
follows:

real=X effective=Y saved=Y

(We ignore the file-system user ID, since it tracks the effective user ID.) Show
the setuid(), seteuid(), setreuid(), and setresuid() calls, respectively, that
would be used to perform the following operations:

a) Suspend and resume the set-user-ID identity (i.e., switch the effective user
ID to the value of the real user ID and then back to the saved set-user-ID).

b) Permanently drop the set-user-ID identity (i.e., ensure that the effective
user ID and the saved set-user-ID are set to the value of the real user ID).

(This exercise also requires the use of getuid() and geteuid() to retrieve the
process’s real and effective user IDs.) Note that for certain of the system
calls listed above, some of these operations can’t be performed.
